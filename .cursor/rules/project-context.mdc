# Project Context

## Repository Overview

This is the **XM Cloud Front End Application Starter Kits** repository containing multiple Next.js starter applications and SPA examples for Sitecore XM Cloud development.

Repository Structure:
- `/examples/` - Contains starter front-end applications (Next.js and SPA)
- `/authoring/` - Sitecore content items, templates, and deployment configurations  
- `/local-containers/` - Docker setup for local development environments
- `xmcloud.build.json` - Primary configuration for XM Cloud deployment

## Starter Applications

Available Examples:
- `basic-nextjs` - Simple Next.js starter with basic XM Cloud integration
- `kit-nextjs-article-starter` - **Solterra & Co.** - Editorial-style template for lifestyle brands
- `kit-nextjs-location-finder` - **Alaris** - Car brand template with location finder functionality
- `kit-nextjs-product-listing` - **SYNC** - Product-focused template for audio gear companies
- `kit-nextjs-skate-park` - Simple demo site showcasing component examples
- `basic-spa` - SPA starter kit with Angular and Node proxy

Each starter demonstrates:
- Tailwind-based styling with Shadcn/ui components
- Personalized homepage via URL parameters
- Modular component architecture with variants
- Localization support for English (en) and Canadian English (en-CA)

## Technology Stack

Core Technologies:
- **Next.js 14+** - React framework with App Router and Pages Router support
- **TypeScript** - Strict type safety throughout all components
- **Sitecore XM Cloud** - Headless content management and delivery
- **Sitecore Content SDK** - Modern SDK for XM Cloud integration
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS with container queries (@container)
- **Shadcn/ui** - Modern component library with accessibility features

Additional Libraries:
- **Framer Motion** - Animation library for interactive components
- **Lucide React** - Icon library for consistent iconography  
- **next-localization** - Internationalization with dictionary support
- **change-case** - String case transformation utilities

Development Tools:
- **Docker** - Containerized local development with Sitecore CM
- **Node.js LTS** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **npm** - Package management across all starter applications

## Development Principles

Multi-Starter Architecture:
- Each example is a standalone application
- Shared patterns and conventions across all starters
- Independent deployment and development workflows
- Common XM Cloud integration patterns

Content-First Development:
- Components are designed around Sitecore data structures
- Field-driven rendering with proper fallbacks
- Support for both connected and disconnected development modes
- Proper handling of content authoring scenarios

## Constraints and Guidelines

File Organization:
- Each starter maintains its own `src/` directory structure
- Shared utilities should be copied, not shared (no monorepo linking)
- Configuration files specific to each starter application
- Independent package.json for each example

Development Workflow:

DMZ git flow will be implemented in the future to support better development practices, scaling, efficiency and developer productivity.
Below is an outline of the planned workflow and processes that will be followed:

- Has a shared main repo (`upstream repository`) with two key branches: `main` and `dmz`
- Each contributor uses their own fork as their workspace
- Feature branches are sourced from `main` but Pull Requests (PRs) with changes are merged to `dmz` branch 
- `main` branch in the `upstream repository` is always clean (deployable, branchable and reliable). It does not accept PRs created by developers.
- Developers should push changes to feature branches in their own fork and then create PRs to `dmz` branch in the `upstream repository`.  
- PRs are merged by reviewers to the `dmz` branch after review and validation. Conflicts should be resolved by rebasing onto main. 
- Once a PR has been merged into `dmz` branch the code changes are validated through an automated full build of the `dmz` branch `HEAD` in the Continous Integration server.  
- The `dmz` branch acts as a staging/integration branch and once sevearl chnages are integrated and tested in the `dmz` branch they can be manually merged to the `main` branch using merge commits (usually at the end of 1 or 2 weeks)
- If the build fails, the changes are or issues are found in the `dmz` branch during integration, the problamatic commits can be reverted

- Each starter can be developed independently in its own directory
- Copy `.env.remote.example` to `.env.local` for local development
- Required environment variables: `SITECORE_EDGE_CONTEXT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SITE_NAME`, `SITECORE_EDITING_SECRET`
- Docker containers available for full local Sitecore development stack

Local Development Setup:
```bash
# Navigate to any starter
cd examples/kit-nextjs-article-starter

# Copy environment template
cp .env.remote.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your XM Cloud values
# Install dependencies and start
npm install
npm run dev
```

Deployment:
- Uses `xmcloud.build.json` for rendering host configuration
- Each starter can be enabled/disabled for deployment via `enabled` flag
- Supports multiple rendering hosts in single repository
- Automatic editing host creation when split deployment is disabled
- Environment-specific configuration through XM Cloud Deploy Portal
